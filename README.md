Read me questions:

#1 On the first page of our project we have the title of our oproject then a image of students learning in the dark with only a candle to see. When you click on that picture it shows an image of the meaning of Dumsor accoring to the Ghana energy sector. In the bottom of the image theres 2 buttons labled light and dark. One makes the background page white and the other black. The second page titled "about dumsor" shows a image of kids learning something with only a tortch light to see. In the bottom of the image theres a text which talks about signicficance of power outages in Ghana and why light on and light offs are called Dumsor in Ghana. When you mousover that text is changes the text to say "LETS STOP THIS". Additionally, theres three different cards in the bottom of that describe more indepth what is dumsor?, who are the people affected? and what causes dumsor? On the third page it is a link to a resources page where we found most of our information regardign Dumsor in Ghana for this project. On the last page titled "Possible Solutions" we have a table of problems and possible solutions. 

#2 JavaScript expanded the functionallity of our website because we were able to add mouseovers to certain parts of our projects and also we were also able to add functions where when we click on on a text, image or button it changes to whatever we want it to change to. 

#3 The features me and my teamate are proud of most was the ability to change the card colors to black when i use the mouse to hover over the card. Another feature we were most proud of was when you click on the image on the home page it changes to another image. 

#4 If we had more time we would add another page or we would add more DOM manipulations to our pages.

#5 Justice; I was able to added the DOM manipulations needed and also made sure to style the project correctly.

Salma; I added the images cards, and made sure nvabars linked correctly.
